This section describes the implementation of The LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogleNet CNN architectures for the recognition of 43 classes of traffic signs [KSH12, SLJ+14, LBBH98]. These three models were implemented in succession. This workflow was designed with the purpose of incremental learning: starting with the most basic CNN architecture (LeNet) and working up towards a robust model (GoogleNet). The three models were programmed using TensorFlow 2 and slightly differ from their original forms. All three models were trained, tested, and evaluated on the GTSRB data set. KerasTuner, an easy-to-use, hyperparameter optimization framework that uses search algorithms to find the best hyperparameters, was used in this project.
